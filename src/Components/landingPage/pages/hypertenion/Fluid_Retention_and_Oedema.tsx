        <h2>What Is Fluid Retention and How Is Salt Involved?</h2>
        <p>Fluid retention, also known as oedema, happens when your body holds on to excess water. Eating too much salt is one of the main reasons this occurs. Salt draws water into your bloodstream and tissues, which can cause swelling in your hands, feet, ankles, and even your face.</p>
        <p>While occasional fluid retention isn’t usually serious, persistent oedema can signal underlying health issues, such as kidney problems, heart failure, or liver disease.</p>

        <h2 className="section-title">How Salt Causes Fluid Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Retention in Tissues:</strong> Salt attracts water. When you eat a salty meal, your body holds on to extra water to balance the sodium levels in your blood. This can lead to swelling in different parts of your body.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Blood Volume:</strong> The extra fluid increases the volume of blood in your veins, putting more pressure on your heart and blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain on Organs:</strong> Persistent fluid retention can strain your kidneys and heart, making existing health conditions worse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">Symptoms of Fluid Retention and Oedema</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Swelling in your feet, ankles, hands, or face.</li>
            <li>Tightness in your skin or puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Stiff joints or difficulty moving swollen areas.</li>
            <li>Rapid weight gain from water retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">Who’s at Risk?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Those with Heart or Kidney Conditions:</strong> These organs are already under stress, and salt worsens the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Pregnant Women:</strong> Hormonal changes can make the body more sensitive to salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Older Adults:</strong> The body becomes less efficient at processing salt with age.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">How to Reduce Fluid Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limit Salty Foods:</strong> Avoid processed foods like canned soups, salty snacks, and fast food.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drinking more water can actually help flush out excess salt and reduce fluid retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat Potassium-Rich Foods:</strong> Foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, and spinach can counteract the effects of sodium.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Movement helps your body get rid of excess fluid, especially in the legs and feet.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Your Salt Intake:</strong> Use herbs and spices for flavour instead of reaching for the salt shaker.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>If you experience sudden or severe swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain, seek medical attention immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition, such as heart or kidney problems.</p>

        <h2 className="section-title">Did You Know?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Just one high-salt meal can cause noticeable fluid retention for several hours.</li>
            <li>Reducing salt intake can significantly decrease swelling and improve your overall comfort.</li>
        </ul>
