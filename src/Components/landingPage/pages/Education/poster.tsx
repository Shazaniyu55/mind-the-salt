        <h3>Section 1: Introduction to Sodium</h3>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>
          This section introduces what sodium is, explains its important roles in our bodies, and outlines why it is a crucial part of our diets. By the end of this section, you should understand the difference between sodium and salt and know why our bodies need sodium.
        </p>

        <h4>What is Sodium?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Sodium is a naturally occurring element that is soft and silvery-white when pure. It reacts easily with other elements, especially chlorine, to form sodium chloride—commonly known as table salt. In the body, sodium acts as an electrolyte, which means it carries an electric charge when dissolved in fluids such as blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sodium vs. Salt:</strong>{` It's important to distinguish between sodium and salt. Table salt is a compound made up of about 40% sodium and 60% chloride. Most of the sodium we eat comes from salt.`}
        </p>

        <h4>Why Do We Need Sodium?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Fluid Balance:</strong> Sodium is crucial for keeping the right balance of fluids in your body. It helps control your blood pressure and is vital for staying hydrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nerve Function:</strong> Sodium is essential for sending electrical signals in the nervous system. These signals are necessary for everything from moving your muscles to feeling sensations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Overall Function:</strong> Sodium works with potassium, another electrolyte, to help maintain your body’s acid-base balance, move nutrients into cells, and remove waste products.
        </p>

        <h4>Sodium in Our Daily Lives</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Culinary Uses:</strong> Beyond health, sodium chloride (table salt) is a staple in kitchens worldwide because it enhances flavours, preserves food, and helps cure meats.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Industrial Uses:</strong> Sodium is also used in many industrial applications. For example, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, is used in baking, cleaning, and even in fire extinguishers.

        </p>

        <h4>Health Risks of Excessive Sodium</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</strong> Consuming too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure because sodium holds excess fluid in the body, putting extra pressure on your heart and blood vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Heart Disease:</strong> High blood pressure from excessive sodium intake can increase the risk of heart diseases, including heart attack and heart failure, where the heart cannot pump blood effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Stroke:</strong> High blood pressure is a major contributor to the risk of stroke, which happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kidney Damage:</strong> Sodium can overwork the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering out excess sodium. Over time, this can lead to kidney disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bone Loss (Osteoporosis):</strong> High sodium intake can cause the body to lose calcium, which is necessary for strong bones. This process can lead to osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and more likely to break.
        </p>

        <h4>Sensitive Populations</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Salt Sensitivity:</strong> Certain individuals, particularly those with existing health conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or hypertension, or older adults, people of African descent, are more vulnerable to the effects of sodium and may experience more severe health impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Genetics can also play a role in how your body reacts to sodium, affecting your blood pressure and overall health risks associated with high sodium intake.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Heart Disease:</strong> High blood pressure from excessive sodium intake can increase the risk of heart diseases, including heart attack and heart failure, where the heart cannot pump blood effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Stroke:</strong> High blood pressure is a major contributor to the risk of stroke, which happens when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kidney Damage:</strong> Sodium can overwork the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering out excess sodium. Over time, this can lead to kidney disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bone Loss (Osteoporosis):</strong> High sodium intake can cause the body to lose calcium, which is necessary for strong bones. This process can lead to osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and more likely to break.
        </p>

        <h4>Sensitive Populations</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Salt Sensitivity:</strong> Certain individuals, particularly those with existing health conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or hypertension, or older adults, people of African descent, are more vulnerable to the effects of sodium and may experience more severe health impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Genetics can also play a role in how your body reacts to sodium, affecting your blood pressure and overall health risks associated with high sodium intake.
        </p>

        <h4>Public Health Concerns</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Treating health conditions related to high sodium intake is costly for healthcare systems. Effective sodium reduction in the population can significantly lower these costs.
