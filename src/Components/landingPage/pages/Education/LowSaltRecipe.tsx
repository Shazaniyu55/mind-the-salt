        </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="instructions">
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> Rinse the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents stickiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Tomato Mixture:</strong> Stir in the blended red bell pepper and chopped green bell pepper, cook for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste, cook for about 5 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Spices:</strong> Incorporate the smoked paprika, thyme, bay leaf, cayenne pepper (if using), curry powder, and black pepper into the tomato mixture. Stir well to combine and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer the Rice:</strong> Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring to coat it thoroughly with the tomato mixture. Pour in the low-sodium vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and remove the bay leaf. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley or coriander before serving.</li>

            <li><strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> Place the sliced meat in a large bowl and drizzle with vegetable oil. Toss to coat evenly. Add about half of the Suya spice mixture to the meat, reserving the rest for later use. Ensure each piece is well-coated with the spice. Cover and let the meat marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for deeper flavour.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill the Suya:</strong> Preheat your grill, griddle, or a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Thread the marinated meat onto skewers. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes beforehand to prevent burning.

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Sprinkle the cooked Suya with the reserved spice mixture for an extra layer of flavour. Serve hot, accompanied by slices of onion, tomato, and cucumber, or a side of simple salad.</li>

        <h2>Low-Salt Moin Moin Recipe</h2>
    </div>
    <div className="ingredients">
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups black-eyed peas, soaked overnight and skins removed</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, deseeded and chopped</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Bean Mixture:</strong> Drain the soaked black-eyed peas and rub them between your hands or in a towel to remove as much of the skins as possible. In a blender, combine the skinned black-eyed peas, onion, red and green bell peppers, Scotch bonnet pepper, and garlic. Add just enough water to facilitate blending. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the Seasonings:</strong> Transfer the blended mixture to a large bowl. Stir in the ground crayfish (if using), turmeric, cumin, and olive oil. Mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of spices.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap the Pudding:</strong> Prepare your steaming vessel by bringing water to a simmer. If using banana leaves, scald them briefly in hot water to make them pliable. Cut into rectangles large enough to hold a few tablespoons of the bean mixture. Alternatively, prepare squares of aluminum foil. Spoon the bean mixture into the leaves or foil and fold securely, ensuring the mixture is well contained.</li>
            <li><strong>Steam the Moin Moin:</strong> Place the wrapped puddings in a steamer basket or on a rack above the simmering water in a covered pot. Steam for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the Moin Moin feels firm and has solidified. The cooking time may vary depending on the size of the puddings.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the Moin Moin to cool slightly before unwrapping. It can be served warm or at room temperature. Moin Moin is versatile and can be enjoyed on its own, with a side of rice, or as part of a larger meal.</li>
